# Liver Patient Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithm

## Description


## Data Description
This data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records. The data set was collected from north east of Andhra Pradesh, India. Selector is a class label used to divide into groups (liver patient or not). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.

 Age of the patient: Any patient whose age exceeded 89 is listed as being of age "90

 Gender of the patient

 TB Total Bilirubin: A bilirubin test measures the amount of bilirubin in your blood. It’s used to help find the cause of health conditions like jaundice, anaemia, and liver disease. Bilirubin is an orangeyellow pigment that occurs normally when part of your red blood cells break down.

 DB Direct Bilirubin: Higher than normal levels of bilirubin may indicate different types of liver problems.

 Alkphos Alkaline Phosphotase: If you show signs of liver disease or a bone disorder, your doctor may order an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) test to measure the amount of the enzyme in your blood and help in diagnosing the problem.

 Sgpt Alamine Aminotransferase: The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test is a blood test that checks for liver damage.

 Sgot Aspartate Aminotransferase: AST is an enzyme your liver makes. Other organs, like your heart, kidneys, brain, and muscles, also make smaller amounts. AST is also called SGOT.

 TP Total Protiens

 ALB Albumin: An albumin blood test is a type of liver function test. Liver function tests are blood tests that measure different enzymes and proteins in the liver, including albumin. An albumin test may also be part of a comprehensive metabolic panel, a test that measures several substances in your blood.

 A/G Ratio Albumin and Globulin Ratio

 Selector field used to split the data into two sets (labeled by the experts): Selector is a class label used to divide into groups(liver patient or not).
